# So, youâ€™re a new Repository Librarian, now what?

Prepared by: CARL Repositories Community of Practice Steering Committee

Repositories have been part of the service offerings of Canadian academic libraries for quite some time. During this evolution a lot of different things have happened. Keeping track of and breaking into this work can be daunting. This document represents a checklist of things to monitor and review, a compendium of ideas in development, and places to go to get in touch with other CARL Librarians working in the repository world.

## Background Information

The repository is a fusion of many different components of librarianship and getting background knowledge on these different pieces is essential to developing an understanding of the landscape.

## Repository Platforms

While there are many different repository platforms the bulk of market share is currently on some version of [DSpace](https://dspace.lyrasis.org/). However there is still a lot of information to share about how platforms are constructed and shared.

[Canadian Repository Platforms](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LYaS1fbnYNEeWTN3ribt4j5whIfOIGIy-KXYgwfpspg/edit#gid=842684754) - A comprehensive list of all of the different Canadian repositories associated with universities along with information about what platform/version they are, and some dynamics about inclusion criteria and what content they collect.

## Metadata & PIDS
